# During this project, these are specific areas I have worked on.
During this project, as a ***fullstack-er*** I made sure to work on both frontend and backend.
***Below are my CONTRIBUTIONS***

- I worked on setting up on our core app using the django_cms framework. i added settings, urls, - templates.
- Then i worked on the footer for frontend, to be used generally. 
- I worked on the contact us page(frontend).
- I also worked on the profile-settings page(frontend).
- I also wrote the login authentication for our core app.

### I was assigned
- setting up and integrating core app(backend).
- contact-us page(frontend).
- profile-settings(frontend).
- portfolio(frontend athough i didn't work on it because it was reassigned to other people).

During this project, i have been able to handle a **no_template error(issue)**. Debugged extensively and had to make sure with my colleague **@MikeSoft007** that every part is connected and working.
below is the link to all the my commits made on this repo. I  had fun working with my amzing team mates.
